# Call for Contributions

We invite contributions that connect **host-star chemical abundances** with **exoplanet interiors and atmospheric composition**, particularly for **K and M dwarf hosts** and in the context of **JWST** and **ARIEL**.

## How to submit
- Submission link: ****
- Deadline: **March 31th, 2026**

## What we are looking for
We welcome contributions on:
- Abundance precision and systematics for cool stars (K/M dwarfs)
- Disk chemistry, inheritance, and fractionation, and its connection to host star abundance
- Interior constraints (Fe/Mg/Si, Mg/Si, volatile budgets)
- Exoplanet atmospheric retrievals and chemical interpretation (metallicity, C/O, disequilibrium)
- Bridging frameworks: consistent reference scales and joint modeling strategies

## Presentation formats
- **Invited speaker:** 20-25 min + 5 min Q&A  
- **Contributed talks:** 10 min + 2 min Q&A  
- **Posters:** encouraged (details will be posted once CS23 poster guidance is finalized)

## Selection and policies
Talk selections will prioritize:
- Scientific relevance to the session theme
- Methodological clarity (especially on uncertainties/systematics)
- Diversity across career stage, geography, and institutions

> **Reminder:** CS23 follows a one-person–one-talk policy across the entire meeting.
