The session is organized into two 90-minute blocks, separated by a 20-minute coffee break.

### <i>Block 1 — Star–planet Connection and Interiors (90 min)</i>
  
  *State-of-the-art overview of the star–planet chemical connection, with emphasis on precision and systematics for cool-star abundances and planetary composition constraints.*
  
- **Invited keynote:** Dr. Vardan Adibekyan
  *(25 min + 5 min Q&A)*  
  Title + Abstract (soon)    
  
- **Contributed talks:** 5 × (10 min + 2 min)  
  Topics may include: abundance systematics in K/M dwarfs, disk fractionation and inheritance, interior-structure constraints from Fe/Mg/Si, and empirical star–planet composition offsets.

### <i>Break (20 min)</i>

### <i>Block 2 — Host-Star Abundances and Exoplanetary Atmospheres: Connections and Interpretation (90 min)</i>
- **Invited keynote: Dr. Luis Welbanks** 20 min + 5 min Q&A  
  *How atmospheric properties (metallicity, C/O, disequilibrium chemistry) relate to host-star abundances and interior physics in the JWST era.*

- **Contributed talks:** 4 × (10 min + 2 min)  
  Topics may include: JWST results and comparative trends, retrieval systematics tied to stellar abundances, and pathways to consistent chemical scales.

- **Discussion panel (15 min)**  
  Moderated audience discussion to identify key uncertainties, priorities for homogeneous analyses, and opportunities for cross-community collaboration.

> **Note:** The detailed speaker list and schedule will be posted here once the submission process has finalized. We expect mid-April.
