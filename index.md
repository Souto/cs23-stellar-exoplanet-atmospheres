# Connecting Stellar Chemistry to Exoplanet Structure and Atmospheres

This CS23 splinter session brings together the **Cool Stars** and **exoplanet** communities to discuss how **host-star chemical abundances** inform (and sometimes fail to predict) **exoplanet interiors and atmospheric composition**, especially in the **JWST and ARIEL era**.

## When and where
- **Conference:** Cool Stars 23 (Tokyo, Japan)
- **Session length:** 180 minutes (two 90-minute blocks with a 20-minute break)
- **Format:** 2 invited keynotes + contributed talks + moderated discussion panel

## Why this session
Many key atmospheric targets orbit **K and M dwarfs**, yet accurate stellar abundances for cool stars remain challenging due to molecular blends, activity, and model systematics. This session focuses on establishing realistic links between **stellar chemistry**, **planet formation and structure**, and **retrieved atmospheric properties**.

## Quick links
- **Call for contributions:** see [Call for Contributions](/call-for-contributions/)
- **Program:** see [Program](/program/)

> **Reminder:** CS23 follows a **one-person–one-talk** policy. Plenary speakers cannot give a talk in a splinter session, and no one can present in more than one splinter.
