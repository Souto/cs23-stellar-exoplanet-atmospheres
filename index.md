## Welcome

This CS23 splinter session brings together the Cool Stars and exoplanet communities to discuss how **host-star chemical abundances** inform (and sometimes fail to predict) **exoplanet interiors** and **atmospheric composition**, especially in the **JWST and ARIEL era**.

## When and where

- **Conference:** Cool Stars 23 (Tokyo, Japan)  
- **Session length:** 180 minutes (two 90-minute blocks with a 20-minute break)  
- **Format:** keynotes + contributed talks + moderated discussion panel  

## Why this session

Many key atmospheric targets orbit **K and M dwarfs**, yet accurate stellar abundances for cool stars remain challenging due to molecular blends, activity, and model systematics. This session focuses on establishing realistic links between **stellar chemistry**, **planet formation and structure**, and **retrieved atmospheric properties**.

> **Reminder:** CS23 follows a **one-person–one-talk** policy. Plenary speakers cannot give a talk in a splinter session, and no one can present in more than one splinter.
